Title: Project on building a BDD framework with Page Object model pattern using Playwright using a simple functionality

Demonstration of using the Playwright to automate the functionality of visiting the Lloyds bank web page and finding nearby branches
I have added necessary configuration on Playwright.config.js

All dependencies are added on package.json including Cucumber. It is added by installing npm i @cucumber/cucumber

A cucumber json file is created to add the feature file and step definition glue paths

folder structure created in the form of BDD 

How and what to install: 
1. Node
2. npm
3. playwright package - can be done either using npm init playwright@latest or by typing playwright install on the command pallette

   
How to run the file: Use npm test or npm run test
You can also use npm cucumber-js as all the javascript libraries related to cucumber are stored in the cucumber-js file in Node modules.
